## Minimum Supported Rust Version

- Rust **1.42**

## Status

This project is an incomplete work-in-progress in an early developmental
stage and will not be ready to use for some time.

## Building dependencies

- [Xargo](https://crates.io/crates/xargo), for the time being. `cargo install
xargo` (run this command *outside* the `firmware` directory)

## Development dependencies

- `arm-none-eabi-gcc`, only required if modifying assembly (`.s`) files

- `qemu-system-arm` v4.x, to run firmware on the host and for some unit testing.
  Install with `pacman -S qemu-arch-extra` on Arch Linux.

## Building examples

As the `armv7-none-eabi` target is not in `rustc` / `rustup` you'll have to use
Rust nightly and Xargo for now.

``` rust
$ # run this command from this directory
$ export RUST_TARGET_PATH=$(dirname `pwd`)

$ xargo build --example $example_name
```

*NOTE* You'll need to set the `RUST_TARGET_PATH` variable to use *any* Xargo
command that involves building, including `xargo run`.

## Running on QEMU

The examples whose name is prefixed with `qemu-` are meant to be run on QEMU and
not on hardware. To run these example use the following QEMU command:

(more details about QEMU & Rust, including debugging QEMU programs, can be found
in the [Embedded Rust book][book])

[book]: https://rust-embedded.github.io/book/start/qemu.html

``` console
$ qemu-system-arm \
  -cpu cortex-a7 \
  -machine mcimx6ul-evk  \
  -nographic \
  -semihosting-config enable=on,target=native \
  -kernel $path_to_binary
```

Or simply run:

``` rust
$ xargo run --example $example_name
```

If a example doesn't explicitly terminate itself, press `C-a` + `c` to bring up
the QEMU console then enter the `quit` command to terminate QEMU.
